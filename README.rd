This is a clone of my attempt to make a website for the original PlayStation game: Yu-Gi-Oh! - Forbidden Memories using Django and React primarily.

I am cloning this repo because I am having some issues and wanted to re-create the app using a slightly different approach so that I may be able to root out the cause of the problem.
